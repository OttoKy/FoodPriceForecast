A upcoming data analysis and machine learning project for predicting future food prices in Finland using various historical data. 
This repository will include exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementation of time series forecasting models.


**Note**: The current implementation of the `LSTMModel` class has only been tested with synthetic data. Further testing and evaluation with real-world data are required to assess its performance and suitability for the task.
