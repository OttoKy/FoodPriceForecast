**Note**: This is a simple and small example of a time series forecasting model using LSTM, intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex models.



# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
This repository contains a simple time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. 
The model predicts future values based on historical time series data. 
This project is primarily intended for educational purposes and for practicing deep learning with PyTorch.
